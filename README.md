## I am a recent Software Development graduate with a strong academic background and a passion for data analytics. I have completed the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate and hold a Bachelor of Science (Honours) in Software Development from Munster Technological University. Through my education and projects, I have gained hands-on experience in utilising machine learning models, analysing data, and developing user-friendly applications. I have a solid foundation in software development, a keen interest in data-driven insights and I am eager to contribute to a data focused dynamic organisation.
